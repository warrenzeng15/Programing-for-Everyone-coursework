# Programing-for-Everyone-coursework
This repository contains some of my course work from "CSCI 133 - Programming for Everyone" at Hunter College, that i completed in Spring 2017.

I have included .py files for Units 1 through 6 of the course, and the corresponding Microsoft word documents that acted as the "lectures" for the course. These word documents also contain the question prompts that my code snippets in each .py file are answering.
