        For example if students refers to the list ['Ed' 'Ted', 'Fred'], then after calling students.append('Jennifer') the list will be ['Ed' 'Ted', 'Fred', 'Jennifer'].
        Write a program using this method to print a list of the lengths of the words given in a list.
        The first line of your program should give a name to the list of words, e.g. students = ['Ed', 'Ted', 'Fred', 'Jennifer'].
        For this example, the output would be [2, 3, 4, 8].

6.  The built-in function input displays a string on the screen and returns a string containing what the user types in response.
    For example, the statement answer = input('How are you feeling? ') will display the given question and wait for the user to type something and press enter.
    Then answer will be assigned to a string that holds what the user has typed.
    Write a program using input that asks the user to type in any number of words and then reports the maximum number of vowels contained in a single word,
    e.g. ‘please’ is a six-letter word containing three vowels.
'''
